# Hash-Table-Database
Upgrade of my Linked List database. Utilizes hashing of employee name and employee ID. Adds a 20% to the highest earning employee's pay in this version and physically removes lowest earner from the database.
"Data.txt" is an example of the input the program takes to build the database.
To run this code, just type 'make' in a terminal. To just compile use the 'make build' command.
